# "Happy for you" or "Sorry that happened" API
Have you ever been told some news and wondered whether you should react with "Happy for you" or "Sorry that happened"?

This API allows you to send a POST request with some news, and it uses the Google Natural Language API to respond with either "Happy for you" or "Sorry that happened".

See it deployed here: https://raynas-gcp-demo-940535980876.europe-west1.run.app/

This API is inspired by the meme "I ain't reading all that, happy for u tho, or sorry that happened".

This project was created using Google Cloud Platform's [cloud-run-microservice-template-nodejs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-microservice-template-nodejs) template following their guide [Quickstart: Deploy to Cloud Run from a git repository](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/deploy-continuously), in order to continuously deploy on every push to the main branch.
